Stardust is simple to setup, even for someone with zero IT knowledge.

Before you get started, make sure that you have the following already set up:
* A PostgreSQL database. You can use Docker to spin one up by running
```bash
docker run --name stardust-postgres -p 5432:5432 -e POSTGRES_PASSWORD=replaceme -d postgres
```
* An Auth0 account. You can sign up for free at [auth0.com](https://auth0.com/). You'll need to get your Issuer, Client ID, and Client Secret.
* Docker setup (Stardust literally depends on Docker)

## Setup
<Steps>
    <Step>
        First, clone the Stardust repository and install the dependencies.
        ```bash
        git clone https://github.com/spaceness/stardust && cd stardust
        pnpm install
        ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
        Next, copy the `.env.example` file to `.env` and fill in the necessary details.
        ```bash
        cp .env.example .env
        ```
    ### General
    `DATABASE_URL`: the connection string to your PostgreSQL database.

    `DOCKER_PORT_RANGE`: the port range that Stardust will use to create containers.

    `CONTAINER_HOST`: the host that the containers will be created on.

    `NEXTAUTH_URL`: the public URL of your Stardust instance.

    `NEXTAUTH_SECRET`: a random string used to encrypt cookies. You can generate one by running `openssl rand -base64 32`.
    ### Docker
    `DOCKER_TYPE`: how you're connecting to docker, either via `socket` or `tcp`.

    `DOCKER_PORT`: the port of your docker instance, this only applies if you're using `tcp`.

    `DOCKER_SOCKET`: the path to your docker socket, this only applies if you're using `socket`.
    ### Auth0
    `AUTH0_ISSUER`: the issuer of your Auth0 account.

    `AUTH0_ID`: the client ID of your Auth0 account.

    `AUTH0_SECRET`: the client secret of your Auth0 account.
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Setup the database
    ```bash
    pnpm db:push
    tsx src/lib/drizzle/seed.ts
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Build Stardust
    ```bash
    pnpm build
    ```
    </Step>
    <Step>
    Start Stardust
    ```bash
    pnpm start
    ```
    It is recommended to use a tool like `pm2` to keep Stardust running in the background.
    Install with `pnpm i -g pm2`, and then run `pm2 start "pnpm start" --name stardust`.
    Stardust will now be running on port 3000.
    </Step>
